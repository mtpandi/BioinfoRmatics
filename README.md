# BioinfoRmatics

###### Bioinformarics PhD candidate

### Project description

**BioinfoRmatics** is my first ever attempt to create teaching material for Bioinformatics with R, as part of the supervision of two R-newbies doing their master thesis in the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx). 
The main goal is to create a set of comprehensive – yet not entirely boring – slides, accompanied by hands-on examples that could be used to cover basic elements of programming with R.

### Outline
1.	Introduction to R 
2.	Data handling and visualization (play with dplyr and ggplot2)
3.	Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning (get an idea of caret and e1071)
4.	PGx project with R


### Disclaimer!
I am aware there is tones and tones of amazing material out there, yet here I am, making my own Introduction to R for Bioinformatics  :octocat:
