# BioinfoRmatics

###### Maria-Theodora Pandi
###### Bioinformatics PhD candidate

### Project description

**BioinfoRmatics** is my first ever attempt to create teaching material for Bioinformatics with R, as part of the supervision of two R-newbies starting their master thesis in the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx). 
The main goal is to create a set of comprehensive – yet not entirely boring – slides, accompanied by hands-on examples that could be used to cover basic elements of programming with R.

### Outline
1.	Introduction to R 
2.	Basic Data handling and visualization 
3.  Data handling and visualization with dplyr and ggplot2
4.	Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning (get an idea of caret and e1071)
5.	PGx project with R


### Disclaimer!
I am aware there is tons and tons of amazing material out there, yet here I am, making my own Introduction to R for Bioinformatics (that wouldn't have been possible without the existence of the beforementioned amazing material)  :octocat:
